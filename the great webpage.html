<h2><strong>My Trip To California</strong></h2>

It was long,quick trip.We loaded our vehicle and headed to Northern California for
the 4th of July weekend for a family reunion. We then made haste to Magic Mountain.
By the time we returned home, we had traveled some 1,300 miles in three and one
half days.</p>

<h2><strong>My Trip To The Rockies</strong></h2>
<p align='justify'>After a year's preparation,it was time to go backpacking with the Boy Scouts. We flew
to colorado Springs, toured the Air Force Acadamy,Pike's Peak, Garden Of The Gods,
and the Olympic training center. We chartered a bus to the Philmont Scout Ranch
Northern New Mexico and began our 60 mile backpack trek.Afterwards, we boarded
Amtrack's and rode the rails to kingman, and then chartered a bus home.

Indiana where he attends college. In route, we stopped at Nauvoo,Illinois, and
