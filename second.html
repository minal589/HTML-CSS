I am licturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a
programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product
designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for
Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycle---from initial product conception through the actual product
launch.<br>

I have a Ph.D from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in software Engineering. My dissertation was on
process support for software engineering teams. I also have a masters degree from Irvine, with a speciallization in Artificial
Intelligence, and bachelors degrres in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
