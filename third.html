Proffesor Richard Zare in his lab. Wheather it's the summer<br>
grass that tickles your feet or the red Boardeaux smacking on<br>
your palate, nearly every part of the world around you carries<br>
special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can<br>
tell scientist where the molecules that compose a substance<br>
are form, where they traveled and what happened to them<br>
along the way. But doing these analyses has been complex<br>
and costly. Now Stanford chemists have developed a new<br>
method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.</p></td>
